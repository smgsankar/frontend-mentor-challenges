# Frontend Mentor Challenges

A Mono-Repo setup using Lerna workspaces to showcase my submissions to challenges [Frontent Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) meanwhile experimenting with stuff I pick up along the way

The main idea is to manage the list of challenges from Frontend Mentor in challenges directory. Any code changes in master will trigger a workflow which will deploy the changes to the specific domains through Firebase Hosting

Challenges Completed so far,

* [QR Code Component](https://qr-component-fe.web.app/)
* [Advice Generator](https://advice-generator-fe.web.app/)
* [Notifications Page](https://notifications-page-fe.web.app/)

### Local Setup

```bash
# Install the dependencies
yarn

# Start the applications in localhost in the respective ports
# Configured in app specific webpack config
# QR Code Component App -> localhost:3001
# Advice Generator App -> localhost:3002
# Notifications Page -> localhost:3003

yarn start
```
